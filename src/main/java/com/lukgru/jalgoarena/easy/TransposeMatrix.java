/**
 * You are given a square 2D image matrix where each integer represents a pixel. Write a method transposeMatrix to transform the matrix into its transpose - in-place. The transpose of a matrix is a matrix which is formed by turning all the rows of the source matrix into columns and vice-versa..
 Examples
 [[1, 2, 3, 4],
 [5, 6, 7, 8],
 [9, 0, 1, 2],
 [3, 4, 5, 0]]
 ->
 [[1, 5, 9, 3],
 [2, 6, 0, 4],
 [3, 7, 1, 5],
 [4, 8, 2, 0]]
