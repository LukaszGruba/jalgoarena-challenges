/**
 * Write a method isHappyNumber to determine whether a positive number is Happy.
 * A number is Happy (Yes, it is a thing!) if it follows a sequence that ends in 1 after following the steps given below:
 * Beginning with the number itself, replace it by the sum of the squares of its digits until either the number becomes 1 or loops endlessly in a cycle that does not include 1.
 * For instance, 19 is a happy number. Sequence: 12 + 92 = 82 8^2 + 2^2 = 68 6^2 + 8^2 = 100 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1.
 * Examples
 19 -> true
