 * A rectangular chocolate bar is divided into squares by horizontal and vertical grooves, in the usual way. It is to be cut into individual squares. A cut is made by choosing a piece and cutting along one of it grooves. (Thus each cut splits one piece into two pieces). Additionally, your chocolate is already cutted into two pieces. Write a method countChocolateCuts with a number answering question - what is the minimal number of cuts needed to completely cut the two parts of chocolate into all its squares?
